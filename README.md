Abstract

While public acceptance is often discussed for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) technologies, this study emphasizes the crucial role of driving actual consumer demand to enable successful mainstream adoption as part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Despite public awareness and ndustry enthusiasm, there is a stark lack of consumer demand for AAM, which could severely hinder implementation and integration into daily life. The study's rationale is to understand the impact of this public indifference and explore how to elevate engagement with AAM. The objectives are to analyze current public perceptions, assess potential demand drivers, and identify conditions that could influence future demand. Through an international survey, the study explored familiarity with AAM, willingness to pay, expectations from the technology, and prioritization of factors such as emissions, convenience, and cost. The findings provide valuable insights into the public's mindset and highlight the importance of connecting AAM's benefits to their daily lives. The impact of this research is far-reaching, as it proposes a well-researched strategy to transform the industry's insular approach into a public-inclusive journey, fostering informed interest and creating a balanced demand that parallels the industry's supply. By aligning public acceptance with technological advancements, this study paves the way for the successful mainstream adoption of AAM.
