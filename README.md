## FlyingCarDemandAnalysis

This project investigates the crucial role of consumer demand in the successful mainstream adoption of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) technologies.

### Introduction

While public acceptance of AAM is a common topic, this study emphasizes the critical need for driving actual consumer demand. Despite public awareness and industry enthusiasm, a significant gap exists in consumer demand for AAM. This gap poses a major hurdle to implementing and integrating AAM into daily life.

### Current Level of Research

The current research focuses on understanding public perception of AAM technologies. An international survey was conducted to assess factors influencing potential demand. This survey explored:

* Familiarity with AAM
* Interest in AAM
* Willingness to pay for AAM services
* Willingness to try for AAM services
* Expectations for AAM technology
* Prioritization of factors like emissions, convenience, and cost


### Getting Started
